                        <h3>Be our guest</h3>

                        <p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>

                        <p>Fellowship Baptist is located off of Highway 50 a few miles south of downtown Creedmoor and just up the road from Raleigh, North Carolina.</p>

                        <p>Our neighborhood is growing and we invite you, our neighbors, to join our church family for worship and Bible study. An historic sanctuary with the familiar feel of a small church, Fellowship has served Creedmoor for a century. Some of our families have deep roots in this community going back generations and others are recently transplanted. Be our guest!</p>

                        <h3>Family-friendly</h3>
                        <p>Weâ€™re a church where families worship together and serve together.</p>
                        <p>In a world of busyness and noise, Fellowship offers a familiar place that feels like home.</p>
                        <h3>Gospel-focused</h3>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote text-info p-4 bg-light">And He said to them, <q class="text-danger">Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature...</q> <cite class="blockquote-footer">Mark 16:15
                            <abbr title="new king james version">NKJV</abbr></cite></blockquote>
                        <h4>Preaching the gospel</h4>
                        <p>Our church exists to fulfil Jesus' <em>Great Commission</em>, <q>preach the gospel to everyone</q>. While our nation and world are wrestling with serious and often divisive questions, Fellowship is a church that remains focused on the Word of God and following the example of Christ. For our neighbors curious about Christianity or just hungry for Bible-based teaching, join us and bring your friends and family.</p>
                        <h4>Growing together</h4>
                        <p>How does a church grow? No gimmicks here. We believe the Word of God doesn't need us to make up extra strategies to bring in more people. The early churches kept it pretty simple: meet regularly, share life with each other, sing and share scripture, take the light into the community. That's how we're growing too. Join us!</p>
                        <h3>Ministry-minded</h3>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote text-info p-4 bg-light">Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus, who, being in the form of God, did not consider it robbery to be equal with God, but made Himself of no reputation, taking the form of a bondservant... <cite class="blockquote-footer">Philippians 2:5-7
                            <abbr title="new king james version">NKJV</abbr></cite></blockquote>
                        <h4>In our church</h4>
                        <p>From our church leadership, deacons and officers to our ministry teams and a number of unrecognized quiet servants, Fellowship relies on our church family to keep everything running. They cook, clean, sing, teach, and maintain our historic facility. Every member is a minister, and every ministry is important.</p>
                        <h4>In our community</h4>
                        <p>You'll see our church members around Creedmoor and Butner at special events. But you'll also find us chipping in other ways. We can't reach our community without being in our community. We probably won't make a big deal about it, but definitely encourage each other to be ministers of the gospel in practical places where we live.</p>
                        <h4>Around the world</h4>
                        <p>From our regular tithes and offerings to ministry trips across the region and the world, members of Fellowship are contributing to efforts to meet the needs of our neighbors.</p>

                    <dl>
                        <dt>How should I dress?</dt>
                        <dd>Sunday mornings most folks dress business casual, but nobody's judging you. We do appreciate some modesty in graphics and the fit of clothes.</dd>
                        <dt>Do you use hymnals?</dt>
                        <dd>Mostly, yes, but we do throw in a couple choruses here and there.</dd>
                        <dt>Do you collect offering?</dt>
                        <dd>Yes, but guests are not obliged to contribute, though we'd appreciate if you fill our a guest attendance card.</dd>
                        <dt>Do you have a liturgy?</dt>
                        <dd>Sort of. No robes or candles here. We observe Lord's Supper ( eucharist ) at special times and baptize new believers upon request. Our typical Sunday service consists of prayer, singing, tithes and offerings, and a sermon.</dd>
